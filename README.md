# Pathfinding Visualizer

You can test the visualizer [here](https://imaique.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer-2/).

This project was heavily inspired by [Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer).

## Pathfinding Algorithms

- **[A\* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)**
- **[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)**
- **[Greedy Best-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search)**
- **[Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)**
- **[Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)**

## Maze-Generating Algorithms

- **[Randomized Depth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_depth-first_search)**

**_NOTE:_** I first attempted to complete this project using React. Unfortunately, changing the state of a cell of a matrix bottle necked the visualization. You can still have a look at the repository of the attempt [here](https://github.com/imaique/pathfinding-visualizer).
